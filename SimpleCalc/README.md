# SimpleCalc Generated Project

This project is built on top of the original `SimpleCalc` example project to verify if this project can be used practically, and document the steps taken to generate and build it. This can be used as a verbose guide to ANTLR4 as well.

## Background

While tools like [Antlr4BuildTasks](https://github.com/kaby76/Antlr4BuildTasks) exist to extend the build flow to include G4 files into .NET projects, certain flows such as those in Unity and until recently Godot might not provide the same amount of flexibility to do so. This project uses base ANTLR4 for code generation, and demonstrates using AntlrDenter in the `SimpleCalc` example.

## Building SimpleCalc

### Prerequisites

* .NET 8.0.
* Python 3.12.
    * `antlr4-tools==0.2.1` via Pip.

        ```sh
        $ pip install antlr4-tools==0.2.1
        ```
* Java 11.

    For this project, the Eclipse Temurin distribution has been used. You can install this via [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io/jdks#tem) or [directly via binaries](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=11).

    ```sh
    $ curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
    $ source "~/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
    $ sdk install java 11.0.25-tem
    ```

### Restore the project

Let .NET resolve the project dependencies. At the solution directory where `AntlrDenter.sln` is, run `dotnet restore`.

```sh
$ dotnet restore
```

### Generating the ANTLR4 Autogenerated code in `./Generated` from `SimpleCalc.g4`

```sh
$ antlr4 ./SimpleCalc/SimpleCalc.g4 -Dlanguage=CSharp -visitor -o ./SimpleCalc/Generated
```
